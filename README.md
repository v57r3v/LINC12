Sept 27,   2024
Practice   exercise   due:   Wednesday   October   2nd, 23:59   on   Quercus
The   following   exercises   must   be   completed   by   uploading   a   PDF   document   onto   Quercus.    These   exercises   cover   material   through   the   Thursday   September   26 lecture.Remember:   These   problems   are   designed   to   make   you   think   critically   and   to   apply   what   you   have   learned this   last   week   to   new   issues.    These   problems   will   be   discussed   in   the   following   lecture,   after   this   practice exercise   is   due.   The   exact   same   problems   appear   on your   assignments   at   the   end   of the   month,   so   do your best, and   take   good   note   of   the   solutions   presented   in   lecture.
Enjoy!
1                               Generalized   Implicatures vs.    Use-conditional   meaningGeneralized   implicatures   and   Use-conditional   meanings   alike   often   arise   due   to   the   semantics   of   a   particular “trigger”.   Generalized   implicatures,   however,   have   all   the   features   of   conversational   implicatures,   however,   while   Use-conditional   meanings   do   not.   Below   you   will   find   sentences   with   a   highlighted   “trigger”, followed by   an   inference.    Your   task   is   to   determine   whether   the   inference   is   a   Generalized   implicature,   a   product   of Use-conditional   meaning,   or   neither.    You   can   do   this by   going   through   the   characteristics   of each   type   of inference   and performing tests to   demonstrate the   inferences   are more   like   on   type   of   meaning   than   the   other.
(1)            Sonya         prefers      vegetarian   meals.
Inference:   Sonya   is   not a vegetarian.
Cancelability:
“Sonya   prefers   vegetarian   meals; she   is a   vegetarian.”
Good!
Reinforceability:
“Sonya   prefers   vegetarian   meals,   but she   is   not a   vegetarian.”
Good!
Calculability:
The   calculation   would   involve   the   maxim   of   quantity:   why   didn’t   you   make   the   stronger   statement   that Sonya was   a vegetarian?
Survive non-veridical environments:
“Does   Sonya   prefer   vegetarian   meals?”
She   is a vegetarian.   No contradiction, so the proposition in the   inference   does   not project.Conclusion:   The   inference   is   a   generalized   implicature   –   it   shows   the   properties   of conversational   implicatures,   and   the   inference   is   lost   under   a   non-veridical   environment   and   is   therefore   not   a   use-   conditional meaning.
(2)            Ginger   rode         a      bike   to   work   today.
Inference:   The   bike   was   not her bike.
Cancelability:
“Ginger rode       a      bike   to   work   today,   in   fact   it   was   her   bike.”
Good!
Reinforceability:
“Ginger rode       a      bike   to   work   today, and   it was   not   her   bike.”
Good!
Calculability:
The   calculation   would   involve   the   maxim   of   quantity:   why   didn’t   you   make   the   stronger   statement   that “Ginger   rode   her   bike   to   work”?
Survive non-veridical environments:
“If   Ginger rode   a   bike   to   work   today, she   won’t need   a   ride   home.”    no   longer   implicates   that   some bike   is   not   hers.       (note:   contradiction   tests   for   the   implicatures   of   indefinite   articles   give   strange   results)
Conclusion:   The   inference   is   a   generalized   implicature   –   it   shows   the   properties   of conversational   implicatures,   and   the   inference   is   lost   under   a   non-veridical   environment   and   is   therefore   not   a   use-   conditional meaning.
(3)            I was       barely      able to hear   what   she   said.
Inference:   It   was   difficult   to   he代 写LINC12 Fall 2024 Practice Exercise 3Matlab

Cancelability:
“I was       barely      able   to   hear what she   said,   #   but   it   was   not   difficult   to   hear   her.”
Bad!
Reinforceability:
“I was       barely      able   to   hear what she said,   #   and   it   was   difficult   to   hear   her.”
Kinda weird!      Calculability:
This meaning is not   calculable.
Survive non-veridical environments:
“If   you   were   barely able   to hear what   she said, why   didn’t   you say   something?”
It   was   not   difficult   to   hear   her.    Does   not   result   in   a   contradiction;   the   proposition   in   the   inference   does   not project.Conclusion:    The   inference   cannot   be   an   implicature   –   it   does   not   show   any   properties   of conver-   sational   implicatures.    However,   the   inference   also   does   not   survive   a   non-veridical   environment,   so   it   is   not likely to be   a   use-conditional   meaning.    The   inference   is   neither   a   generalized   implicature,   nor   a   use-conditional meaning.
(4)                Tomakealongstoryshort   , we’ve   decided   to   include   Regina   in   the   competition.
Inference:   The details   of   the decision aren’t worth   mentioning.
Cancelability:
‘To   make   a   long story   short,   we’ve   decided   to   include   Regina   in   the   competition,   #   but   the   details   of the   decision are   worth   mentioning.”
Kinda weird?
Reinforceability:
‘To   make   a   long story short,   we’ve   decided   to   include Regina   in   the   competition,   and   the   details   of   the   de-   cision aren’t worth   mentioning.”
Not   bad, not   normal   speech   however?   Calculability:
This meaning is not   calculable.
Survive non-veridical environments:
“If,   to   make a long   story short,   you decided   to   include Regina,   why   didn’t   you say   something earlier?”
#   The   details   are   worth   mentioning.    This   is   a   very   strange   dialogue.    The   speaker-oriented   inference   re-   mains.Conclusion:    The   inference   is   likely   not   an   implicature   –   it   does   not   clearly   properties   of conver-   sational   implicatures.      On   the   other   hand,   the   inference   seems   to   still   be   present   after   embedding   in   non-veridical environment, so it is most likely a use-conditional meaning.
2                               Speech   ActsBelow   you   are   presented   with   a   number   of   sentences.   Your   job   is   to   identify, descriptively,   the   illocutionary force   of   these   sentences   if   uttered   in   the   real   world, and   then   to   classify   this   illocutionary   force   under   one   of Searle’s   classes   of   illocutionary   acts   (see   lecture   4,   slide   31).
(5)          Do   you   know   what   time   it   is?
Illocutionary   force:   to   get   the   addressee   to   tell   the   speaker   what   the   time   is
Classification:   Directive
(6)            Stay   off   the   subway   tracks!
Illocutionary   force:   to   get   the   addressee   to   not   touch   the   subway   tracks
Classification:   Directive
(7)            It   will   be   a   clear   day,   with   a   high   of   23   degrees.
Illocutionary   force:   to   assert   the   fact   that   the   weather   will   be   as   such
Classification:   Representative
(8)            Sorry   for   the   late   response.
Illocutionary force:   to express remorse
Classification:   Expressive
(9)          I   brought   you   this   gift   back   from   my   trip!
Illocutionary   force:   to   present   a   gift   to   the   addressee
Classification:   Commissive
(10)            Can   you   feed   my   cat   while   I’m   away?
Illocutionary   force:   to   get   the   addressee   to   feed   their   cat
Classification:   Directive
